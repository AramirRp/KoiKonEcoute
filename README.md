Second personnal project, currently in the making. 

first feature available : being able to lsiten to the 30sec of any songs from one of your playlist from spotify (need an account).
issues : diverse issues with the spotify API. 

upcoming features : 

- complete change of the music system (exit spotify api)
- adding a search feature
- adding the random feature to get an album (as made in my previous repo KoiKonEcoute)
- rework of the css
- adding a listenlist ?
